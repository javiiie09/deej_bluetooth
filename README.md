# deej bluetooth

deej is an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. In this build i have taken the original deej idea and make it work wirellessly. [original](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

## Features

deej is written in Go and [distributed](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases/latest) as a portable (no installer needed) executable.

- Bind apps to different sliders
  - Bind multiple apps per slider (i.e. one slider for all your games)
  - Bind the master channel
  - Bind "system sounds" (on Windows)
  - Bind specific audio devices by name (on Windows)
  - Bind currently active app (on Windows)
  - Bind all other unassigned apps
- Control your microphone's input level
- Lightweight desktop client, consuming around 10MB of memory
- Runs from your system tray
- Helpful notifications to let you know if something isn't working
- Wireless connection
- See your volume levels on the display

## How it works

### Hardware

- The sliders are connected to 5 (or as many as you like) analog pins on an Arduino Nano/Uno board. They're powered from the board's 5V output (see schematic)
- The board connects via a USB cable or bluetooth to the PC

#### Schematic

![Hardware schematic](assets/schematic.png)

### Software

- The code running on the Arduino board is a [C program](./arduino/deej-5-sliders-vanilla/deej-5-sliders-vanilla.ino) constantly writing current slider values over its serial interface
- The PC runs a lightweight [Go client](./pkg/deej/cmd/main.go) in the background. This client reads the serial stream and adjusts app volumes according to the given configuration file

## Slider mapping (configuration)

deej uses a simple YAML-formatted configuration file named [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml), placed alongside the deej executable.

The config file determines which applications (and devices) are mapped to which sliders, and which parameters to use for the connection to the Arduino board, as well as other user preferences.

**This file auto-reloads when its contents are changed, so you can change application mappings on-the-fly without restarting deej.**

It looks like this:

```yaml
slider_mapping:
  0: master
  1: chrome.exe
  2: spotify.exe
  3:
    - pathofexile_x64.exe
    - rocketleague.exe
  4: discord.exe

# set this to true if you want the controls inverted (i.e. top is 0%, bottom is 100%)
invert_sliders: false

# settings for connecting to the arduino board
com_port: COM4
baud_rate: 9600

# adjust the amount of signal noise reduction depending on your hardware quality
# supported values are "low" (excellent hardware), "default" (regular hardware) or "high" (bad, noisy hardware)
noise_reduction: default
```

- `master` is a special option to control the master volume of the system _(uses the default playback device)_
- `mic` is a special option to control your microphone's input level _(uses the default recording device)_
- `deej.unmapped` is a special option to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider ("everything else")
- On Windows, `deej.current` is a special option to control whichever app is currently in focus
- On Windows, you can specify a device's full name, i.e. `Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)`, to bind that device's level to a slider. This doesn't conflict with the default `master` and `mic` options, and works for both input and output devices.
  - Be sure to use the full device name, as seen in the menu that comes up when left-clicking the speaker icon in the tray menu
- `system` is a special option on Windows to control the "System sounds" volume in the Windows mixer
- All names are case-**in**sensitive, meaning both `chrome.exe` and `CHROME.exe` will work
- You can create groups of process names (using a list) to either:
    - control more than one app with a single slider
    - choose whichever process in the group that's currently running (i.e. to have one slider control any game you're playing)

## Build your own!

Building deej is very simple. You only need a few relatively cheap parts - it's an excellent starter project (and my first Arduino project, personally). Remember that if you need any help or have a question that's not answered here, you can always [join the deej Discord server](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu).

Build deej for yourself, or as an awesome gift for your gaming buddies!

### Bill of Materials

- An Arduino Nano, Pro Micro or Uno board
  - I officially recommend using a Nano or a Pro Micro for their smaller form-factor, friendlier USB connectors and more analog pins. Plus they're cheaper
  - You can also use any other development board that has a Serial over USB interface
- A few slider potentiometers, up to your number of free analog pins (the cheaper ones cost around 1-2 USD each, and come with a standard 10K Ohm variable resistor. These _should_ work just fine for this project)
  - **Important:** make sure to get **linear** sliders, not logarithmic ones! Check the product description
  - You can also use circular knobs if you like
- Some wires
- A bluetooth module
  - I recommend the HC-05 or HC-06 for better compatibility (Bluetooth 2.1) or if you know that your computer supports newers versions of bluetooth the HM-10 or AT-09 (BLE 4.0)
- Batteries (LI-ION)
  - It can be one, two or more. Use it in parallel instead of serie, the arduino only need 5V.
- Boost-up module
- Battery charge module
  - It's useful if you want to charge your batteries, use it while charging or you can remove the batteries and power it.
- Micro USB or USB-C port.
- BSM
  - It's a protection module for the batteries


### Build procedure

- Connect everything according to the [schematic](#schematic)
- Test with a multimeter to be sure your sliders are hooked up correctly
- Flash the Arduino chip with the sketch in [`arduino\deej-5-sliders-vanilla`](./arduino/deej-5-sliders-vanilla/deej-5-sliders-vanilla.ino)
  - _Important:_ If you have more or less than 5 sliders, you must edit the sketch to match what you have
- After flashing, check the serial monitor. You should see a constant stream of values separated by a pipe (`|`) character, e.g. `0|240|1023|0|483`
  - When you move a slider, its corresponding value should move between 0 and 1023
- Congratulations, you're now ready to run the deej executable!

## How to run

### Requirements

#### Windows

- Windows. That's it

#### Linux

- Install `libgtk-3-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` for system tray support. Pre-built Linux binaries aren't currently released, so you'll need to [build from source](#building-from-source). If there's demand for pre-built binaries, please [let me know](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu)!

### Download and installation

- Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases) and download the [latest version](https://github.com/omriharel/deej/releases/latest)'s executable and configuration file (`deej.exe` and `config.yaml`)
- Place them in the same directory anywhere on your machine

### Building from source

If you'd rather not download a compiled executable, or want to extend deej or modify it to your needs, feel free to clone the repository and build it yourself. All you need is a Go 1.14 (or above) environment on your machine. If you go this route, make sure to check out the [developer scripts](./pkg/deej/scripts).

Like other Go packages, you can also use the `go get` tool: `go get -u github.com/omriharel/deej`. Please note that the package code now resides in the `pkg/deej` directory, and needs to be imported from there if used inside another project.

If you need any help with this, please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu).
